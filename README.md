This script demonstrates an optimization approach to maximize energy production from solar and wind resources using weather data. It starts by importing necessary libraries and generating a sample dataset with random solar radiation and wind speed values for one year. The efficiencies for solar and wind energy conversion are set to 20% and 30%, respectively. The objective function `energy_production` calculates the total energy production from both sources based on the number of solar and wind units deployed, and returns the negative of this value for minimization purposes. A constraint ensures that the total number of units for solar and wind installations does not exceed a budget of 100 units. Using the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function, the script finds the optimal allocation of solar and wind units to maximize energy production. The results, including the optimized number of units for each energy source and the corresponding maximum energy production, are then printed.
